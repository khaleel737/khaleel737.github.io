Our DAG is made up of roughly 150 SQL queries. It takes roughly 10 minutes to run, using BigQuery &amp;ndash; with on-demand pricing. This is quite decent. However, the results of our DAG feed customer dashboards, and we have the (bad) habit of refreshing the DAG several times a day. Reducing the runtime by a few minutes can thus be a nice quality-of-life improvement.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Hard data integration problems at Carbonfact</title><link>https://maxhalford.github.io/blog/hard-data-integration-problems-at-carbonfact/</link><pubDate>Thu, 02 Jan 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>maxhalford25@gmail.com (Max Halford)</author><guid>https://maxhalford.github.io/blog/hard-data-integration-problems-at-carbonfact/</guid><description>&lt;p>Carbonfact&amp;rsquo;s customers are clothing brands and factories. Our mission is to measure (and ultimately reduce) the carbon footprint of their products. We need primary data to do this: purchase orders, bills of materials, energy consumption data, etc.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Each customer has a unique IT setup, which makes it challenging to scale to hundreds/thousands of customers. Our success as a business depends on our ability to not reinvent the wheel for each customer.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Introducing icanexplain @ PyData Paris 2024</title><link>https://maxhalford.github.io/blog/icanexplain-pydata/</link><pubDate>Thu, 26 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>maxhalford25@gmail.com (Max Halford)</author><guid>https://maxhalford.github.io/blog/icanexplain-pydata/</guid><description/></item><item><title>@daily_cache implementation in Python</title><link>https://maxhalford.github.io/blog/python-daily-cache/</link><pubDate>Tue, 27 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>maxhalford25@gmail.com (Max Halford)</author><guid>https://maxhalford.github.io/blog/python-daily-cache/</guid><description>&lt;p>I spend a lot of time at Carbonfact working on datasets shared by our customers. We typically set things up so that our customers can export data automatically. They usually deposit files to a GCP bucket, with a script, once a day. We then have an ETL script for each customer that runs afterwards to fetch their latest data and process it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>During development, I load customer data to my laptop and work on it. The datasets can be quite heavy, and it takes time to fetch them, so I cache them to save some time.

This is a methodology that breaks down a product&amp;rsquo;s life cycle into stages (&lt;a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Life-cycle_assessment#Life_cycle_inventory_(LCI)">LCI&lt;/a>), and measures the impact of each stage on the environment (&lt;a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Life-cycle_assessment#Life_cycle_impact_assessment_(LCIA)">LCIA&lt;/a>).&lt;/p>

This involves a lot of steps. The main one is to determine what materials a product is made of, along with each material&amp;rsquo;s mass. This is straightforward for most clothes like jumpers and pants. These are typically made of a single fabric, such as cotton or polyester. The mass of each material is roughly the same as the product&amp;rsquo;s mass.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>A training set for bike sharing forecasting</title><link>https://maxhalford.github.io/blog/bike-sharing-forecasting-training-set/</link><pubDate>Thu, 04 Apr 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>maxhalford25@gmail.com (Max Halford)</author><guid>https://maxhalford.github.io/blog/bike-sharing-forecasting-training-set/</guid><description>&lt;style>

The talks were about generative AI and information retrieval, which aren&amp;rsquo;t topics I&amp;rsquo;m knowledgeable about. However, one of the speakers was a &lt;a href="https://github.com/raphaelsty">friend&lt;/a> of mine, so I went to support him. Toulouse is my hometown, so I bumped into a few people I knew.

&lt;p>I talked about metric decomposition in a &lt;a href="https://maxhalford.github.io/blog/kpi-evolution-decomposition">previous article&lt;/a>, and how it can be used to explain why metrics change values over time. That article explained how to decompose a sum, as well as a ratio. In this article, I&amp;rsquo;ll explain how to decompose a product.&lt;/p>
&lt;pre tabindex="0">&lt;code>revenue = impressions * click_rate * conversion_rate * spend
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>The decomposition in this article isn&amp;rsquo;t limited to funnels. It can be applied to any metric that is expressed as a product of factors.

In a nutshell, this means that most of the data transformation is done in the data warehouse. This has become the &lt;em>de facto&lt;/em> standard for modern data teams, and is epitomized by &lt;a href="https://www.getdbt.com/">dbt&lt;/a> and its ecosystem. It&amp;rsquo;s a great time to be a data engineer!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We at &lt;a href="https://www.carbonfact.com/">Carbonfact&lt;/a> fully embrace the ELT paradigm. In fact, our whole platform is powered by BigQuery, which acts as our single source of truth. We have a main BigQuery dataset where we materialize severalÂ SQL views that power what our customers see.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Online machine learning on the road @ IDE+A, TH KÃ¶ln</title><link>https://maxhalford.github.io/blog/online-machine-learning-on-the-road/</link><pubDate>Thu, 26 Oct 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>maxhalford25@gmail.com (Max Halford)</author><guid>https://maxhalford.github.io/blog/online-machine-learning-on-the-road/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Sh*t flows downhill, but not at Carbonfact</title><link>https://maxhalford.github.io/blog/shit-flows-downhill-but-not-at-carbonfact/</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 Oct 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>maxhalford25@gmail.com (Max Halford)</author><guid>https://maxhalford.github.io/blog/shit-flows-downhill-but-not-at-carbonfact/</guid><description>&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m writing this after watching the talk &lt;a href="https://josephreis.com/">Joe Reis&lt;/a> gave at &lt;a href="https://bigdataldn.com/">Big Data LDN&lt;/a>. It&amp;rsquo;s called &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&amp;amp;v=OCClTPOEe5s&amp;amp;ref=blef.fr">Data Modeling is Dead! Long Live Data Modeling!&lt;/a> It&amp;rsquo;s an easy-to-watch short talk that calls out on a few modern issues in the data world.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;d like to bounce off one of Joe&amp;rsquo;s slides:&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m aligned with Joe that many issues stem from the lack of unison between engineering and data teams. A fundamental aspect of the Modern Data Stack is to replicate/copy production data into an analytics warehouse.

The notebook decomposes a ratio, but the logic is also valid for decomposing a sum.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Edit 2&lt;/strong> &amp;ndash; &lt;em>I&amp;rsquo;ve stumbled on &lt;a href="https://medium.com/@shaozhifei/metric-decomposition-formula-to-understand-metric-trend-e693b7a4c8cf">this article&lt;/a> by Shao Zhifei which provides a good derivation of the ratio decomposition formula.

&lt;p>Regarding food, the French government has a great initiative called &lt;a href="https://agribalyse.ademe.fr/">Agribalyse&lt;/a>. It&amp;rsquo;s a free database of environmental footprints for various food products. It includes raw ingredients straight out from the farm, as well as ready to eat dishes from the supermarket.

&lt;p>Graph problems are quite common. However, it&amp;rsquo;s rare to have access to a database offering graph semantics. There are graph databases, such as &lt;a href="https://neo4j.com/">Neo4j&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/graphx-programming-guide.html">GraphX&lt;/a>, but it&amp;rsquo;s difficult to justify setting one of those up. One could simply use &lt;a href="https://networkx.org/">networkx&lt;/a> in Python. But that only works if the graph fits in memory.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>From a practical angle, the fact is that people are querying data warehouses in SQL. There are many good reasons to write graph algorithms in SQL. And anyway, one may argue that graphs are a special case of the &lt;a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Relational_model">relational model&lt;/a>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>For analytics, don't use dynamic JSON keys</title><link>https://maxhalford.github.io/blog/no-dynamic-keys-in-json/</link><pubDate>Thu, 11 May 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>maxhalford25@gmail.com (Max Halford)</author><guid>https://maxhalford.github.io/blog/no-dynamic-keys-in-json/</guid><description>&lt;p>I love the JSON format. It&amp;rsquo;s the kind of love that grows on you with time. Like others, I&amp;rsquo;ve been using JSON everywhere for so many years, to the point where I just take it for granted.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I suppose the main thing I like about JSON is its flexibility. You can structure your JSONs without too much care. There will always be a way to consume and manipulate it. But I have discovered a bit of anti-pattern, which I believe is worth raising awareness about. Especially when you&amp;rsquo;re doing analytics.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Metric correctness doesn't matter, consistency does</title><link>https://maxhalford.github.io/blog/consistent-metrics/</link><pubDate>Fri, 28 Apr 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>maxhalford25@gmail.com (Max Halford)</author><guid>https://maxhalford.github.io/blog/consistent-metrics/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://www.un.org/en/dayof8billion">According to&lt;/a> the United Nations, the 15th of November &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/newsround/63632981">was the day&lt;/a> we crossed 8 billion humans on the planet. How can they be so sure of that? Surely there has to be some margin of error, meaning it could have happened on the 14th or 16th. Then again, does it matter?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I would argue almost all metrics we look at are incorrect. For instance, I work at a company who&amp;rsquo;s goal is to measure the carbon footprint of clothing items. I can tell you first hand our measurements are stock full of assumptions. In the sustainability world, it&amp;rsquo;s not surprising to get reports like this one:&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Online gradient descent written in SQL</title><link>https://maxhalford.github.io/blog/ogd-in-sql/</link><pubDate>Tue, 07 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>maxhalford25@gmail.com (Max Halford)</author><guid>https://maxhalford.github.io/blog/ogd-in-sql/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;strong>Edit&lt;/strong> &amp;ndash; &lt;em>this post &lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35054786">generated&lt;/a> a few insightful comments on Hacker News.

&lt;p>Modern MLOps is complex because it involves too many components. You need a message bus, a stream processing engine, an API, a model store, a feature store, a monitoring service, etc. Sadly, containerisation software and the unbundling trend have encouraged an appetite for complexity. I believe MLOps shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be this complex. For instance, MLOps can be made simpler by &lt;a href="https://www.ethanrosenthal.com/2022/05/10/database-bundling/">bundling the logic into your database&lt;/a>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Using SymPy in Python doctests</title><link>https://maxhalford.github.io/blog/sympy-doctests/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Feb 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>maxhalford25@gmail.com (Max Halford)</author><guid>https://maxhalford.github.io/blog/sympy-doctests/</guid><description>&lt;p>A program which compiles and runs without errors isn&amp;rsquo;t necessarily correct.

A good active learning strategy minimizes the number of necessary labels, while maximizing a model&amp;rsquo;s performance. This usually works by focusing on samples where the model is unsure of its prediction.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In a batch setting, the model is periodically retrained to learn from the freshly labeled samples. However, the training time is usually too prohibitive for this to happen each time a new label is provided. This isn&amp;rsquo;t the case with online models, because they are able to learn one sample at a time. Active and online learning naturally fit together.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Are Airbnb guests less energy efficient than their host?</title><link>https://maxhalford.github.io/blog/airbnb-energy-usage/</link><pubDate>Tue, 17 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>maxhalford25@gmail.com (Max Halford)</author><guid>https://maxhalford.github.io/blog/airbnb-energy-usage/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="tldr">TLDR&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I compared the energy consumption of Airbnb guests versus their host, in the same appartment, during 2022. It appears that guests do in fact consume more energy than hosts. The data I used is available to any Airbnb host. I also open-sourced all the code I wrote for this analysis.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="introduction">Introduction&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>European energy prices have soared in 2022. It&amp;rsquo;s gone to the point where some Airbnb hosts have become reluctant to rent, believing their guests are too wasteful and cost too much.

&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve recently been spending time at my brother&amp;rsquo;s place. We usually eat in front of TV. I&amp;rsquo;ve thus found myself typing stuff on the Netflix/Amazon/Plex TV apps. The typing happens through a remote controller, which is slower than typing with ones fingers. However, the TV apps usually suggest the correct show/movie after five or six keystrokes, so it&amp;rsquo;s not that bad.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>NLP at Carbonfact: how would you do it?</title><link>https://maxhalford.github.io/blog/carbonfact-nlp-open-problem/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>maxhalford25@gmail.com (Max Halford)</author><guid>https://maxhalford.github.io/blog/carbonfact-nlp-open-problem/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="the-task">The task&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I work at a company called &lt;a href="https://www.carbonfact.com/">Carbonfact&lt;/a>. Our core value proposal is computing the &lt;a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Carbon_footprint">carbon footprint&lt;/a> of clothing items, expressed in &lt;a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Carbon_Dioxide_Equivalent">carbon dioxide equivalent&lt;/a> &amp;ndash; $kgCO_2e$ in short. For instance, we started by measuring the footprint of shoes &amp;ndash; no pun intended. We do these measurements with &lt;a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Life-cycle_assessment">life cycle analysis (LCA)&lt;/a> software we built ourselves. We use these analyses to fuel higher-level tasks for our clients, such as &lt;a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Carbon_accounting">carbon accounting&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Sustainable_procurement">sustainable procurement&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A life cycle analysis is essentially a recipe, the output of which is a carbon footprint assessment. Like any recipe, an LCA necessitates ingredients. In a &lt;a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Life-cycle_assessment#/Cradle-to-gate">cradle-to-gate&lt;/a> scenario, this includes everything that is needed to make the product: the materials, the mass, the manufacturing methods, the transport between factories, etc. In our experience, the biggest impact on a product&amp;rsquo;s footprint come from the materials which it is made of.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Matrix inverse mini-batch updates</title><link>https://maxhalford.github.io/blog/matrix-inverse-mini-batch/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>maxhalford25@gmail.com (Max Halford)</author><guid>https://maxhalford.github.io/blog/matrix-inverse-mini-batch/</guid><description>&lt;p>The inverse covariance matrix, also called &lt;a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Precision_matrix">precision matrix&lt;/a>, is useful in many places across the field of statistics. For instance, in machine learning, it is used for &lt;a href="https://maxhalford.github.io/blog/bayesian-linear-regression">Bayesian regression&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/mixture.html#gmm">mixture modelling&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What&amp;rsquo;s interesting is that any batch model which uses a precision matrix can be turned into an online model. That is, provided the precision matrix can be estimated in a streaming fashion. For instance, scikit-learn&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.covariance.EllipticEnvelope.html#sklearn.covariance.EllipticEnvelope">elliptic envelope&lt;/a> method could have an online variant with a &lt;code>partial_fit&lt;/code> method.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>A rant against dbt ref</title><link>https://maxhalford.github.io/blog/dbt-ref-rant/</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 Jun 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>maxhalford25@gmail.com (Max Halford)</author><guid>https://maxhalford.github.io/blog/dbt-ref-rant/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="disclaimer">Disclaimer&lt;/h2>

&lt;p>This week Saulo Mastelini and I got to meet in person. This is worth mentioning because Saulo is originally from Brazil, whereas I&amp;rsquo;m based in Europe. We connected and I&amp;rsquo;m glad to think of him as a good friend from now on. Of course we were not alone: some friends of mine from university also joined the fun.

&lt;p>Say we&amp;rsquo;re looking for a pattern in a blob of text. If you know the text has no typos, then determining whether it contains a pattern is trivial. In Python you can use the &lt;code>in&lt;/code> function. You can also write a regex pattern with the &lt;code>re&lt;/code> module from the standard library. But what about if the text contains typos? For instance, this might be the case with user inputs on a website, or with OCR outputs. This is a much harder problem.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>OCR spelling correction is hard</title><link>https://maxhalford.github.io/blog/ocr-spelling-correction-is-hard/</link><pubDate>Sun, 06 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>maxhalford25@gmail.com (Max Halford)</author><guid>https://maxhalford.github.io/blog/ocr-spelling-correction-is-hard/</guid><description>&lt;p>I recently saw &lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30576435">SymSpell&lt;/a> pop up on Hackernews.

&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s not easy to get my hands on many of them. Luckily enough I found a website called &lt;a href="https://readcomiconline.li/">ReadComicOnline&lt;/a> which is delightfully profuse.

&lt;p>Fact: designing open source software is hard. It&amp;rsquo;s difficult to make design decisions which don&amp;rsquo;t make any compromises. I like to fall back on Dieter Rams&amp;rsquo; &lt;a href="https://ifworlddesignguide.com/design-specials/dieter-rams-10-principles-for-good-design">10 principles for good design&lt;/a>. I feel like they apply rather well to software design. Especially when said software is open source, due to the many users and the plethora of use cases.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I had to make a significant design decision for &lt;a href="https://github.com/online-ml/river/">River&lt;/a>. It boils down to the fact that making a prediction with a model pipeline is a stateful operation, whereas users understandably expect it to be pure with no side-effects.

&lt;p>Web scraping is the art of extracting information from web pages. A web page is essentially an amalgamation of HTML tags. Usually, we&amp;rsquo;re looking for a particular piece of information on a given web page. This may be done by fetching the HTML content of the page in question, and then running some HTML parsing logic. It&amp;rsquo;s quite straightforward.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are many tools in the wild to perform web scraping.

There are three types of prescriptions: lenses, glasses, and pharmaceutical prescriptions. Different information needs to be extracted depending on the prescription type. Therefore, the first step is to classify the prescription. The prescriptions we receive are pictures taken by users with their phone. We run each image through an OCR to obtain a text transcription of the image. We can thus use the text transcription to classify the prescription.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>An overview of dataset time travel</title><link>https://maxhalford.github.io/blog/dataset-time-travel/</link><pubDate>Wed, 07 Apr 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>maxhalford25@gmail.com (Max Halford)</author><guid>https://maxhalford.github.io/blog/dataset-time-travel/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="tldr">TLDR&lt;/h2>

&lt;p>Most supervised machine learning algorithms work in the batch setting, whereby they are fitted on a training set offline, and are used to predict the outcomes of new samples. The only way for batch machine learning algorithms to learn from new samples is to train them from scratch with both the old samples and the new ones. Meanwhile, some learning algorithms are online, and can predict as well as update themselves when new samples are available. This encompasses any model trained with &lt;a href="https://leon.bottou.org/publications/pdf/compstat-2010.pdf">stochastic gradient descent&lt;/a> &amp;ndash; which includes deep neural networks, &lt;a href="https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~b97053/paper/Rendle2010FM.pdf">factorisation machines&lt;/a>, and &lt;a href="https://www.cs.huji.ac.il/~shais/papers/ShalevSiSrCo10.pdf">SVMs&lt;/a> &amp;ndash; as well as &lt;a href="https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~pedrod/papers/kdd00.pdf">decision trees&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://ai.stanford.edu/~ang/papers/icml04-onlinemetric.pdf">metric learning&lt;/a>, and &lt;a href="https://people.csail.mit.edu/jrennie/papers/icml03-nb.pdf">naÃ¯ve Bayes&lt;/a>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Online machine learning with decision trees @ Toulouse AOC workgroup</title><link>https://maxhalford.github.io/blog/online-machine-learning-with-decision-trees/</link><pubDate>Thu, 07 May 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>maxhalford25@gmail.com (Max Halford)</author><guid>https://maxhalford.github.io/blog/online-machine-learning-with-decision-trees/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Server-sent events in Flask without extra dependencies</title><link>https://maxhalford.github.io/blog/flask-sse-no-deps/</link><pubDate>Mon, 04 May 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>maxhalford25@gmail.com (Max Halford)</author><guid>https://maxhalford.github.io/blog/flask-sse-no-deps/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Server-sent_events">Server-sent events (SSE)&lt;/a> is a mechanism for sending updates from a server to a client.

&lt;p>Suppose you have an infinite stream of feature vectors $x_i$ and targets $y_i$. In this case, $i$ denotes the order in which the data arrives. If you&amp;rsquo;re doing supervised learning, then your goal is to estimate $y_i$ &lt;em>before&lt;/em> it is revealed to you. In order to do so, you have a model which is composed of parameters denoted $\theta_i$. For instance, $\theta_i$ represents the feature weights when using linear regression. After a while, $y_i$ will be revealed, which will allow you to update $\theta_i$ and thus obtain $\theta_{i+1}$. To perform the update, you may apply whichever learning rule you wish &amp;ndash; for instance most people use &lt;a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Stochastic_gradient_descent#/Extensions_and_variants">some flavor of stochastic gradient descent&lt;/a>. The process I just described is called &lt;a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Online_machine_learning">online supervised machine learning&lt;/a>. The difference between online machine learning and the more traditional batch machine learning is that an online model is dynamic and learns on the fly. Online learning solves a lot of pain points in real-world environments, mostly because it doesn&amp;rsquo;t require retraining models from scratch every time new data arrives.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Under-sampling a dataset with desired ratios</title><link>https://maxhalford.github.io/blog/undersampling-ratios/</link><pubDate>Tue, 17 Dec 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>maxhalford25@gmail.com (Max Halford)</author><guid>https://maxhalford.github.io/blog/undersampling-ratios/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="introduction">Introduction&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve just spent a few hours looking at under-sampling and how it can help a classifier learn from an imbalanced dataset.

Usually I&amp;rsquo;m doubtful of such statements, but in this case I&amp;rsquo;ve never met anyone for whom everything has gone smoothly. Most data scientists might agree that there is a huge gap between their local environment and a live environment. In fact, &amp;ldquo;productionalizing&amp;rdquo; machine learning is such a complex topic that entire companies have risen to address the issue. I&amp;rsquo;m not just talking about running a gigantic grid search and finding the best model, I&amp;rsquo;m talking about putting a machine learning model live so that it actually has a positive impact on your business/project. Off the top of my head: &lt;a href="https://www.cubonacci.com/">Cubonacci&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://www.h2o.ai/">H2O&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://cloud.google.com/automl/">Google AutoML&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/how-it-works-hosting.html">Amazon Sagemaker&lt;/a>, and &lt;a href="https://www.datarobot.com/">DataRobot&lt;/a>. In other words people are making money off businesses because data scientists and engineers are having a hard putting their models into production. In my opinion if a data scientist can&amp;rsquo;t put her model into production herself then something is wrong. Life should be simpler.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The benefits of online machine learning @ Airbus Bizlab</title><link>https://maxhalford.github.io/blog/the-benefits-of-online-learning-airbus-bizlab/</link><pubDate>Fri, 28 Jun 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>maxhalford25@gmail.com (Max Halford)</author><guid>https://maxhalford.github.io/blog/the-benefits-of-online-learning-airbus-bizlab/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Machine learning incrÃ©mental: des concepts Ã  la pratique @ Toulouse Data Science Meetup</title><link>https://maxhalford.github.io/blog/machine-learning-incremental-tds/</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 May 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>maxhalford25@gmail.com (Max Halford)</author><guid>https://maxhalford.github.io/blog/machine-learning-incremental-tds/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Skyline queries in Python</title><link>https://maxhalford.github.io/blog/skyline-queries/</link><pubDate>Tue, 21 May 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>maxhalford25@gmail.com (Max Halford)</author><guid>https://maxhalford.github.io/blog/skyline-queries/</guid><description>&lt;p>Imagine that you&amp;rsquo;re looking to buy a home. If you have an analytical mind then you might want to tackle this with a quantitative. Let&amp;rsquo;s suppose that you have a list of potential homes, and each home has some attributes that can help you compare them. As an example, we&amp;rsquo;ll consider three attributes:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The &lt;code>price&lt;/code> of the house, which you want to minimize&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The &lt;code>size&lt;/code> of the house, which you want to maximize&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The &lt;code>city&lt;/code> where the house if located, which you don&amp;rsquo;t really care about&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Some houses will be objectively better than others because they will be cheaper and bigger. However, for some pairs of houses the comparison will not be as clear. It might be that house A is more expensive than house B but is also larger. In data analysis this set of best houses which are incomparable with each other is called a &lt;a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Skyline_operator">skyline&lt;/a>.

A light curve is a sequence of brightness measures observations along time. Each light curve is filtered at different passbands.

That is, variables which don&amp;rsquo;t have a natural numerical representation. The problem is that most machine learning algorithms require the input data to be numerical. At some point or another a data science pipeline will require converting categorical variables to numerical variables.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are many ways to do so:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.LabelEncoder.html">Label encoding&lt;/a> where you choose an arbitrary number for each category&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.OneHotEncoder.html">One-hot encoding&lt;/a> where you create one binary column per category&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/representation/word2vec">Vector representation&lt;/a> a.k.a. word2vec where you find a low dimensional subspace that fits your data&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/LightGBM/blob/master/docs/Advanced-Topics.rst#categorical-feature-support">Optimal binning&lt;/a> where you rely on tree-learners such as LightGBM or CatBoost&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="http://www.saedsayad.com/encoding.htm">Target encoding&lt;/a> where you average the target value by category&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Each and every one of these method has its own pros and cons. The best approach typically depends on your data and your requirements. If a variable has a lot of categories, then a one-hot encoding scheme will produce many columns, which can cause memory issues. In my experience, relying on LightGBM/CatBoost is the best out-of-the-box method. Label encoding is useless and you should never use it. However if your categorical variable happens to be ordinal then you can and should represent it with increasing numbers (for example &amp;ldquo;cold&amp;rdquo; becomes 0, &amp;ldquo;mild&amp;rdquo; becomes 1, and &amp;ldquo;hot&amp;rdquo; becomes 2). &lt;a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Word2vec">Word2vec&lt;/a> and others such methods are cool and good but they require some fine-tuning and don&amp;rsquo;t always work out of the box.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Stella triangles with JavaScript</title><link>https://maxhalford.github.io/blog/stella-triangles/</link><pubDate>Thu, 26 Apr 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>maxhalford25@gmail.com (Max Halford)</author><guid>https://maxhalford.github.io/blog/stella-triangles/</guid><description>&lt;p>Around the same time last year I visited the &lt;a href="https://www.sfmoma.org/">San Francisco Museum of Modern Art&lt;/a>. &lt;a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Frank_Stella">Frank Stella&lt;/a>&amp;rsquo;s compositions really caught my eye.

&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://maxhalford.github.io/img/blog/stella-triangles/2.jpg" alt="2">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Nice and simple right? Indeed in a lot of his work Frank Stella uses straight lines without much randomness. There are quite a few prints in the V Series. However in each one of them the common denominator is a single triangle. If we have a routine for drawing one triangle then we can use to make compositions. As always let&amp;rsquo;s start by creating a canvas.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Unknown pleasures with JavaScript</title><link>https://maxhalford.github.io/blog/unknown-pleasures/</link><pubDate>Mon, 24 Jul 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>maxhalford25@gmail.com (Max Halford)</author><guid>https://maxhalford.github.io/blog/unknown-pleasures/</guid><description>&lt;p>No this blog post is not about how nice JavaScript can be, instead it&amp;rsquo;s just another one of my attempts at reproducing modern art with &lt;a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Procedural_generation">procedural generation&lt;/a> and the &lt;a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_canvas.asp">HTML5 &lt;code>&amp;lt;canvas&amp;gt;&lt;/code> element&lt;/a>.

The idea was to visualize and analyze bike sharing over multiple cities. &lt;a href="http://axelbellec.fr/">Axel Bellec&lt;/a> joined me and in 2016 we &lt;a href="http://www.opendatafrance.net/2016/02/05/le-prix-open-data-toulouse-metropole-remis-a-openbikes">won a national open data competition&lt;/a>. Since then we haven&amp;rsquo;t pursued anything major, instead we use OpenBikes to try out technologies and to apply concepts we learn at university and online.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Before the 2016 summer holidays one of my professors, &lt;a href="https://www.math.univ-toulouse.fr/~agarivie/">AurÃ©lien Garivier&lt;/a> mentioned that he was considering using our data for a Kaggle-like competition between some statistics curriculums in France. Near the end of the summer, I sat down with a group of professors and we decided upon a format for the so-called &amp;ldquo;Challenge&amp;rdquo;. The general idea was to provide student teams with historical data on multiple bike stations and ask them to do some forecasting which we would then score based on a secret truth. The whole thing lasted from the 5th of October 2016 till the 26th of January 2017 when the best team was crowned.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Challenge Big Data @ TSE</title><link>https://maxhalford.github.io/blog/challenge-big-data/</link><pubDate>Mon, 09 Jan 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>maxhalford25@gmail.com (Max Halford)</author><guid>https://maxhalford.github.io/blog/challenge-big-data/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Halftoning with Go - Part 1</title><link>https://maxhalford.github.io/blog/halftoning-1/</link><pubDate>Sun, 27 Nov 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>maxhalford25@gmail.com (Max Halford)</author><guid>https://maxhalford.github.io/blog/halftoning-1/</guid><description>&lt;p>Recently I stumbled upon &lt;a href="http://www.cgl.uwaterloo.ca/csk/projects/tsp/">this webpage&lt;/a> which shows how to use a TSP solver as a &lt;a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Halftone">&lt;em>halftoning&lt;/em>&lt;/a> technique. I began to read about related concepts like &lt;a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Dither">&lt;em>dithering&lt;/em>&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Stippling">&lt;em>stippling&lt;/em>&lt;/a>. I don&amp;rsquo;t have any background in photography but I can appreciate the visual appeal of these techniques. As I understand it these techniques were first invented to save ink for printing. However nowadays printing has become cheaper and the modern use of these technique is mostly aesthetic, at least for images.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Predire la disponibilitÃ© des Velib' @ Toulouse Data Science Meetup</title><link>https://maxhalford.github.io/blog/forecasting-bicycle-sharing-usage/</link><pubDate>Wed, 30 Mar 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>maxhalford25@gmail.com (Max Halford)</author><guid>https://maxhalford.github.io/blog/forecasting-bicycle-sharing-usage/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Recursive polygons with JavaScript</title><link>https://maxhalford.github.io/blog/recursive-polygons/</link><pubDate>Fri, 25 Mar 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>maxhalford25@gmail.com (Max Halford)</author><guid>https://maxhalford.github.io/blog/recursive-polygons/</guid><description>&lt;p>I like modern art, I enjoy looking at the stuff that was made at the beginning of the 20th century and thinking how it is still shaping today&amp;rsquo;s style. I&amp;rsquo;m not an expert, it&amp;rsquo;s just a hobby of mine. I especially like the &lt;a href="https://www.centrepompidou.fr/">Centre Pompidou&lt;/a> in Paris, it&amp;rsquo;s got loads of fascinating stuff. While I was going through the galleries it struck me that some of the paintings were very geometrical. In fact they were so geometrical that a machine could have produced them! I&amp;rsquo;m not talking about artificial intelligence but rather a set of rules that could be given to a programming language. Through a series of blog posts I would like to try to emulate some works with my computer. I realize it&amp;rsquo;s a waste of time but it&amp;rsquo;s a good opportunity for me to learn some more JavaScript and refreshen my geometry. I also want to insist on making these drawings random, not deterministic.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The NaÃ¯ve Bayes classifier</title><link>https://maxhalford.github.io/blog/naive-bayes/</link><pubDate>Thu, 10 Sep 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>maxhalford25@gmail.com (Max Halford)</author><guid>https://maxhalford.github.io/blog/naive-bayes/</guid><description>&lt;p>The objective of a classifier is to decide to which &lt;em>class&lt;/em> (also called &lt;em>label&lt;/em>) to assign an observation based on observed data. In &lt;em>supervised learning&lt;/em>, this is done by taking into account previous classifications. In other words if we &lt;em>know&lt;/em> that certain observations are classified in a certain way, the goal is to determine the class of a new observation. The first group of observations on which the classifier is built is called the &lt;em>training set&lt;/em>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>An introduction to genetic algorithms</title><link>https://maxhalford.github.io/blog/genetic-algorithms-introduction/</link><pubDate>Sun, 02 Aug 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>maxhalford25@gmail.com (Max Halford)</author><guid>https://maxhalford.github.io/blog/genetic-algorithms-introduction/</guid><description>&lt;p>The goal of genetic algorithms (GAs) is to solve problems whose solutions are not easily found (ie. NP problems, nonlinear optimization, etc.). For example, finding the shortest path from A to B in a directed graph is easily done with &lt;em>Djikstra&amp;rsquo;s algorithm&lt;/em>, it can be solved in polynomial time. However the time to find the smallest path that joins all points on a non-directed graph, also known as the &lt;a href="http://www.wikiwand.com/en/Travelling_salesman_problem">Travelling Salesman Problem&lt;/a> (TSP) increases exponentially as the number of points increases. More generally, GAs are useful for problems where an analytical approach is complicated or even impossible. By giving up on perfection they manage to find a good approximation of the optimal solution.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Setting up a droplet to host a Flask app</title><link>https://maxhalford.github.io/blog/flask-droplet/</link><pubDate>Tue, 14 Jul 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>maxhalford25@gmail.com (Max Halford)</author><guid>https://maxhalford.github.io/blog/flask-droplet/</guid><description>&lt;p>After having worked for some weeks on the &lt;a href="http://openbikes.co">OpenBikes website&lt;/a>, it was time to put it online. &lt;a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/">Digital Ocean&lt;/a> seemed to provide a good service and so I decided to give it a spin. Their documentation is quite good but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t cover exactly everything for setting up Flask. In this post I simply want to record every single step I took.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>OpenBikes is a project with a Flask backend and a few upstart jobs. It lives at the &lt;a href="http://openbikes.co">openbikes.co&lt;/a> domain name. In this blog post I will list every step it takes to make it happen on Ubuntu 14.04 with Apache (it&amp;rsquo;s robust and easy to setup). I didn&amp;rsquo;t always say when to use &lt;code>sudo&lt;/code> before the commands to avoid clutter, however you can safely use it everywhere.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Visualizing bike stations live data</title><link>https://maxhalford.github.io/blog/bike-stations/</link><pubDate>Wed, 03 Jun 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>maxhalford25@gmail.com (Max Halford)</author><guid>https://maxhalford.github.io/blog/bike-stations/</guid><description>&lt;p>Recently some friends and I decided to launch &lt;a href="http://openbikes.co/">openbikes.co&lt;/a>, a website for visualizing (and later on analyzing) urban bike traffic. We have a lot of ideas that we will progressively implement. Anyway, the point is that all of it started with me fiddling about with the &lt;em>JCDecaux&lt;/em> API and the &lt;em>leaflet.js&lt;/em> library and I would like to share it with you. Shall we?&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="presentation">Presentation&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>In this post I want to show you the tools and the code to get a fully functional website for visualizing live data. In this particular case we will display bike stations in Toulouse, however I will keep the scripts as general as possible so they are easily modifiable for different data. Before starting here is a glimpse of the end result:&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
