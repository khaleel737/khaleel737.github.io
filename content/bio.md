Hello ✌️

I’m **Khaleel Musleh** (aka **khaleel737**). I’m the founder & engineer behind **[Etheon](https://etheon.ai/)** — a real-time, self-learning AI platform. My focus is building agentic systems that **learn while they run**: continual/online learning, safety & governance loops, and what I call **Continual Compositional Orchestration (CCO)** for routing, planning, and revalidation at runtime ⚙️🤖

Before Etheon I built high-volume fintech and trading products, shipped production web apps, and spent a lot of time making infrastructure fast, observable, and reliable. I work across the stack: **Python/PyTorch** for models, **TypeScript/Next.js** for product, and systems work when performance matters. I also speak **C++**, **Java**, and **Swift** when needed 🧠💻

My current interests: **online/continual learning** 🍥, **agentic workflows & tool orchestration** 🧭, **HPC & compilers** (CUDA/Triton/TVM) 🚀, **document understanding** 🔬, and battle-tested dev tooling for data & engineering teams 📦. I’m currently based in **Zagreb, Croatia** 🇭🇷 (and often on the move).

I enjoy turning research into working software, writing clear specs, and open-sourcing useful pieces when I can. If you’re exploring real-time AI, governable agents, or want to collaborate on hard problems, I’d love to chat.

Find me on **[GitHub](https://github.com/khaleel737)**, or email **[khaleelmusleh@gmail.com](mailto:khaleelmusleh@gmail.com)** 🤝
