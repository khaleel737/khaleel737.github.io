_See [uses.tech](https://uses.tech/)_

I'm a great admirer of [Choose Boring Technology](https://boringtechnology.club/), [Zen design](https://www.interactiongreen.com/jobs-zen/), and the [KISS principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle). As such I try to keep my tech stack as simple as possible, for instance by using zero-config tools and the Apple ecosystem.

- I use a 14 inch MacBook Pro. I'm often on the go, so I'm not attached to a proper desktop setup
- At home I have a [ASUS ProArt PA278QV](https://www.asus.com/fr/displays-desktops/monitors/proart/proart-display-pa278qv/) + Apple Magic Keyboard
- [AltTab](https://alt-tab-macos.netlify.app/) for window management
- Google Calendar for scheduling pro/personal events
- Apple Notes for writing down thoughts and ideas -- snappier than Notion and does the job
- Apple Reminders on my iPhone for tasks that have a deadline
- Apple Passwords for password management -- it's free!
- [Warp](https://www.warp.dev/) + [zsh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z_shell) for CLI stuff
- All tools are themed with [Ros√© Pine](https://rosepinetheme.com/) when possible
- [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for writing code, including [Jupyter](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-toolsai.jupyter) notebooks
- I store [dotfiles](https://github.com/MaxHalford/dotfiles) on GitHub
- My browser is [Arc](https://arc.net/) -- I heavily use sidebar pins to keep webapps open (e.g. Slack)
- [GitHub Desktop](https://github.com/apps/desktop) for doing git stuff
- [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) for interacting with our overlords
- [GitHub Pro](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/learning-about-github/githubs-plans#github-pro) for running code (e.g. [git scraping](https://github.com/MaxHalford/bike-sharing-history))
- [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/) for writing LaTeX documents
- [Count.co](https://count.co/) is my go-to SQL editor

_My [brother's /uses page](https://0x5.be/uses) is far more sophisticated than mine_
