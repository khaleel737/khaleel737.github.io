However, the results of our DAG feed customer dashboards, and we have the (bad) habit of refreshing the DAG several times a day. Reducing the runtime by a few minutes can be a nice quality-of-life improvement.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Hard data integration problems at Carbonfact</title><link>https://maxhalford.github.io/blog/hard-data-integration-problems-at-carbonfact/</link><pubDate>Thu, 02 Jan 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>maxhalford25@gmail.com (Max Halford)</author><guid>https://maxhalford.github.io/blog/hard-data-integration-problems-at-carbonfact/</guid><description>&lt;p>Carbonfact&amp;rsquo;s customers are clothing brands and factories.

This has become the &lt;em>de facto&lt;/em> standard for modern data teams, and is epitomized by &lt;a href="https://www.getdbt.com/">dbt&lt;/a> and its ecosystem. It&amp;rsquo;s a great time to be a data engineer!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We at &lt;a href="https://www.carbonfact.com/">Carbonfact&lt;/a> fully embrace the ELT paradigm. In fact, our whole platform is powered by BigQuery, which acts as our single source of truth.

&lt;p>Graph problems are quite common. However, it&amp;rsquo;s rare to have access to a database offering graph semantics. There are graph databases, such as &lt;a href="https://neo4j.com/">Neo4j&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/graphx-programming-guide.html">GraphX&lt;/a>, but it&amp;rsquo;s difficult to justify setting one of those up. One could simply use &lt;a href="https://networkx.org/">networkx&lt;/a> in Python. But that only works if the graph fits in memory.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>From a practical angle, the fact is that people are querying data warehouses in SQL. There are many good reasons to write graph algorithms in SQL.

&lt;p>I suppose the main thing I like about JSON is its flexibility. You can structure your JSONs without too much care. There will always be a way to consume and manipulate it.

&lt;p>Modern MLOps is complex because it involves too many components. You need a message bus, a stream processing engine, an API, a model store, a feature store, a monitoring service, etc. Sadly, containerisation software and the unbundling trend have encouraged an appetite for complexity.

A good active learning strategy minimizes the number of necessary labels, while maximizing a model&amp;rsquo;s performance. This usually works by focusing on samples where the model is unsure of its prediction.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In a batch setting, the model is periodically retrained to learn from the freshly labeled samples. However, the training time is usually too prohibitive for this to happen each time a new label is provided. This isn&amp;rsquo;t the case with online models, because they are able to learn one sample at a time. Active and online learning naturally fit together.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Are Airbnb guests less energy efficient than their host?</title><link>https://maxhalford.github.io/blog/airbnb-energy-usage/</link><pubDate>Tue, 17 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>maxhalford25@gmail.com (Max Halford)</author><guid>https://maxhalford.github.io/blog/airbnb-energy-usage/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="tldr">TLDR&lt;/h2>

&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve recently been spending time at my brother&amp;rsquo;s place. We usually eat in front of TV. I&amp;rsquo;ve thus found myself typing stuff on the Netflix/Amazon/Plex TV apps. The typing happens through a remote controller, which is slower than typing with ones fingers. However, the TV apps usually suggest the correct show/movie after five or six keystrokes, so it&amp;rsquo;s not that bad.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>NLP at Carbonfact: how would you do it?</title><link>https://maxhalford.github.io/blog/carbonfact-nlp-open-problem/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>maxhalford25@gmail.com (Max Halford)</author><guid>https://maxhalford.github.io/blog/carbonfact-nlp-open-problem/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="the-task">The task&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I work at a company called &lt;a href="https://www.carbonfact.com/">Carbonfact&lt;/a>. Our core value proposal is computing the &lt;a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Carbon_footprint">carbon footprint&lt;/a> of clothing items, expressed in &lt;a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Carbon_Dioxide_Equivalent">carbon dioxide equivalent&lt;/a> &amp;ndash; $kgCO_2e$ in short. For instance, we started by measuring the footprint of shoes &amp;ndash; no pun intended. We do these measurements with &lt;a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Life-cycle_assessment">life cycle analysis (LCA)&lt;/a> software we built ourselves. We use these analyses to fuel higher-level tasks for our clients, such as &lt;a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Carbon_accounting">carbon accounting&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Sustainable_procurement">sustainable procurement&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A life cycle analysis is essentially a recipe, the output of which is a carbon footprint assessment. Like any recipe, an LCA necessitates ingredients. In a &lt;a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Life-cycle_assessment#/Cradle-to-gate">cradle-to-gate&lt;/a> scenario, this includes everything that is needed to make the product: the materials, the mass, the manufacturing methods, the transport between factories, etc. In our experience, the biggest impact on a product&amp;rsquo;s footprint come from the materials which it is made of.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Matrix inverse mini-batch updates</title><link>https://maxhalford.github.io/blog/matrix-inverse-mini-batch/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>maxhalford25@gmail.com (Max Halford)</author><guid>https://maxhalford.github.io/blog/matrix-inverse-mini-batch/</guid><description>&lt;p>The inverse covariance matrix, also called &lt;a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Precision_matrix">precision matrix&lt;/a>, is useful in many places across the field of statistics.

&lt;p>What&amp;rsquo;s interesting is that any batch model which uses a precision matrix can be turned into an online model. That is, provided the precision matrix can be estimated in a streaming fashion. For instance, scikit-learn&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.covariance.EllipticEnvelope.html#sklearn.covariance.EllipticEnvelope">elliptic envelope&lt;/a> method could have an online variant with a &lt;code>partial_fit&lt;/code> method.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>A rant against dbt ref</title><link>https://maxhalford.github.io/blog/dbt-ref-rant/</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 Jun 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>maxhalford25@gmail.com (Max Halford)</author><guid>https://maxhalford.github.io/blog/dbt-ref-rant/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="disclaimer">Disclaimer&lt;/h2>

&lt;p>This week Saulo Mastelini and I got to meet in person. This is worth mentioning because Saulo is originally from Brazil, whereas I&amp;rsquo;m based in Europe.

&lt;p>Say we&amp;rsquo;re looking for a pattern in a blob of text. If you know the text has no typos, then determining whether it contains a pattern is trivial. In Python you can use the &lt;code>in&lt;/code> function. You can also write a regex pattern with the &lt;code>re&lt;/code> module from the standard library. But what about if the text contains typos? For instance, this might be the case with user inputs on a website, or with OCR outputs. This is a much harder problem.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>OCR spelling correction is hard</title><link>https://maxhalford.github.io/blog/ocr-spelling-correction-is-hard/</link><pubDate>Sun, 06 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>maxhalford25@gmail.com (Max Halford)</author><guid>https://maxhalford.github.io/blog/ocr-spelling-correction-is-hard/</guid><description>&lt;p>I recently saw &lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30576435">SymSpell&lt;/a> pop up on Hackernews.

&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s not easy to get my hands on many of them. Luckily enough I found a website called &lt;a href="https://readcomiconline.li/">ReadComicOnline&lt;/a> which is delightfully profuse. It gives access to comics for free under the murky &amp;ldquo;fair use&amp;rdquo; copyright doctrine.

&lt;p>Fact: designing open source software is hard. It&amp;rsquo;s difficult to make design decisions which don&amp;rsquo;t make any compromises. I like to fall back on Dieter Rams&amp;rsquo; &lt;a href="https://ifworlddesignguide.com/design-specials/dieter-rams-10-principles-for-good-design">10 principles for good design&lt;/a>. I feel like they apply rather well to software design. Especially when said software is open source, due to the many users and the plethora of use cases.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I had to make a significant design decision for &lt;a href="https://github.com/online-ml/river/">River&lt;/a>. It boils down to the fact that making a prediction with a model pipeline is a stateful operation, whereas users understandably expect it to be pure with no side-effects.

&lt;p>Web scraping is the art of extracting information from web pages. A web page is essentially an amalgamation of HTML tags. Usually, we&amp;rsquo;re looking for a particular piece of information on a given web page. This may be done by fetching the HTML content of the page in question, and then running some HTML parsing logic. It&amp;rsquo;s quite straightforward.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are many tools in the wild to perform web scraping.

There are three types of prescriptions: lenses, glasses, and pharmaceutical prescriptions. Different information needs to be extracted depending on the prescription type. Therefore, the first step is to classify the prescription. The prescriptions we receive are pictures taken by users with their phone. We run each image through an OCR to obtain a text transcription of the image.

&lt;p>Most supervised machine learning algorithms work in the batch setting, whereby they are fitted on a training set offline, and are used to predict the outcomes of new samples. The only way for batch machine learning algorithms to learn from new samples is to train them from scratch with both the old samples and the new ones. Meanwhile, some learning algorithms are online, and can predict as well as update themselves when new samples are available. This encompasses any model trained with &lt;a href="https://leon.bottou.org/publications/pdf/compstat-2010.pdf">stochastic gradient descent&lt;/a> &amp;ndash; which includes deep neural networks, &lt;a href="https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~b97053/paper/Rendle2010FM.pdf">factorisation machines&lt;/a>, and &lt;a href="https://www.cs.huji.ac.il/~shais/papers/ShalevSiSrCo10.pdf">SVMs&lt;/a> &amp;ndash; as well as &lt;a href="https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~pedrod/papers/kdd00.pdf">decision trees&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://ai.stanford.edu/~ang/papers/icml04-onlinemetric.pdf">metric learning&lt;/a>, and &lt;a href="https://people.csail.mit.edu/jrennie/papers/icml03-nb.pdf">naïve Bayes&lt;/a>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Online machine learning with decision trees @ Toulouse AOC workgroup</title><link>https://maxhalford.github.io/blog/online-machine-learning-with-decision-trees/</link><pubDate>Thu, 07 May 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>maxhalford25@gmail.com (Max Halford)</author><guid>https://maxhalford.github.io/blog/online-machine-learning-with-decision-trees/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Server-sent events in Flask without extra dependencies</title><link>https://maxhalford.github.io/blog/flask-sse-no-deps/</link><pubDate>Mon, 04 May 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>maxhalford25@gmail.com (Max Halford)</author><guid>https://maxhalford.github.io/blog/flask-sse-no-deps/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Server-sent_events">Server-sent events (SSE)&lt;/a> is a mechanism for sending updates from a server to a client.

&lt;p>Suppose you have an infinite stream of feature vectors $x_i$ and targets $y_i$. In this case, $i$ denotes the order in which the data arrives. If you&amp;rsquo;re doing supervised learning, then your goal is to estimate $y_i$ &lt;em>before&lt;/em> it is revealed to you. In order to do so, you have a model which is composed of parameters denoted $\theta_i$. For instance, $\theta_i$ represents the feature weights when using linear regression. After a while, $y_i$ will be revealed, which will allow you to update $\theta_i$ and thus obtain $\theta_{i+1}$. To perform the update, you may apply whichever learning rule you wish &amp;ndash; for instance most people use &lt;a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Stochastic_gradient_descent#/Extensions_and_variants">some flavor of stochastic gradient descent&lt;/a>. The process I just described is called &lt;a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Online_machine_learning">online supervised machine learning&lt;/a>. The difference between online machine learning and the more traditional batch machine learning is that an online model is dynamic and learns on the fly. Online learning solves a lot of pain points in real-world environments, mostly because it doesn&amp;rsquo;t require retraining models from scratch every time new data arrives.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Under-sampling a dataset with desired ratios</title><link>https://maxhalford.github.io/blog/undersampling-ratios/</link><pubDate>Tue, 17 Dec 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>maxhalford25@gmail.com (Max Halford)</author><guid>https://maxhalford.github.io/blog/undersampling-ratios/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="introduction">Introduction&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve just spent a few hours looking at under-sampling and how it can help a classifier learn from an imbalanced dataset.

Usually I&amp;rsquo;m doubtful of such statements, but in this case I&amp;rsquo;ve never met anyone for whom everything has gone smoothly. Most data scientists might agree that there is a huge gap between their local environment and a live environment. In fact, &amp;ldquo;productionalizing&amp;rdquo; machine learning is such a complex topic that entire companies have risen to address the issue. I&amp;rsquo;m not just talking about running a gigantic grid search and finding the best model, I&amp;rsquo;m talking about putting a machine learning model live so that it actually has a positive impact on your business/project. Off the top of my head: &lt;a href="https://www.cubonacci.com/">Cubonacci&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://www.h2o.ai/">H2O&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://cloud.google.com/automl/">Google AutoML&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/how-it-works-hosting.html">Amazon Sagemaker&lt;/a>, and &lt;a href="https://www.datarobot.com/">DataRobot&lt;/a>. In other words people are making money off businesses because data scientists and engineers are having a hard putting their models into production. In my opinion if a data scientist can&amp;rsquo;t put her model into production herself then something is wrong.

If you have an analytical mind then you might want to tackle this with a quantitative. Let&amp;rsquo;s suppose that you have a list of potential homes, and each home has some attributes that can help you compare them. As an example, we&amp;rsquo;ll consider three attributes:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The &lt;code>price&lt;/code> of the house, which you want to minimize&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The &lt;code>size&lt;/code> of the house, which you want to maximize&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The &lt;code>city&lt;/code> where the house if located, which you don&amp;rsquo;t really care about&lt;/li>

&lt;p>Some houses will be objectively better than others because they will be cheaper and bigger. However, for some pairs of houses the comparison will not be as clear. It might be that house A is more expensive than house B but is also larger.

A light curve is a sequence of brightness measures observations along time. Each light curve is filtered at different passbands.

That is, variables which don&amp;rsquo;t have a natural numerical representation. The problem is that most machine learning algorithms require the input data to be numerical. At some point or another a data science pipeline will require converting categorical variables to numerical variables.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are many ways to do so:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.LabelEncoder.html">Label encoding&lt;/a> where you choose an arbitrary number for each category&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.OneHotEncoder.html">One-hot encoding&lt;/a> where you create one binary column per category&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/representation/word2vec">Vector representation&lt;/a> a.k.a. word2vec where you find a low dimensional subspace that fits your data&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/LightGBM/blob/master/docs/Advanced-Topics.rst#categorical-feature-support">Optimal binning&lt;/a> where you rely on tree-learners such as LightGBM or CatBoost&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="http://www.saedsayad.com/encoding.htm">Target encoding&lt;/a> where you average the target value by category&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Each and every one of these method has its own pros and cons. The best approach typically depends on your data and your requirements. If a variable has a lot of categories, then a one-hot encoding scheme will produce many columns, which can cause memory issues. In my experience, relying on LightGBM/CatBoost is the best out-of-the-box method. Label encoding is useless and you should never use it. However if your categorical variable happens to be ordinal then you can and should represent it with increasing numbers (for example &amp;ldquo;cold&amp;rdquo; becomes 0, &amp;ldquo;mild&amp;rdquo; becomes 1, and &amp;ldquo;hot&amp;rdquo; becomes 2). &lt;a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Word2vec">Word2vec&lt;/a> and others such methods are cool and good but they require some fine-tuning and don&amp;rsquo;t always work out of the box.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Stella triangles with JavaScript</title><link>https://maxhalford.github.io/blog/stella-triangles/</link><pubDate>Thu, 26 Apr 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>maxhalford25@gmail.com (Max Halford)</author><guid>https://maxhalford.github.io/blog/stella-triangles/</guid><description>&lt;p>Around the same time last year I visited the &lt;a href="https://www.sfmoma.org/">San Francisco Museum of Modern Art&lt;/a>. &lt;a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Frank_Stella">Frank Stella&lt;/a>&amp;rsquo;s compositions really caught my eye.

&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://maxhalford.github.io/img/blog/stella-triangles/2.jpg" alt="2">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Nice and simple right? Indeed in a lot of his work Frank Stella uses straight lines without much randomness. There are quite a few prints in the V Series. However in each one of them the common denominator is a single triangle. If we have a routine for drawing one triangle then we can use to make compositions.

&lt;p>I went through different ideas but in the end I settled on a recursive approach. My idea is to divide a rectangle into two smaller ones and then to do the same with each sub-rectangle. Every time a rectangle is generated and is then filled with a random color; like Mondrian I use yellow, red, blue, black and white.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>A short introduction and conclusion to the OpenBikes 2016 Challenge</title><link>https://maxhalford.github.io/blog/openbikes-challenge/</link><pubDate>Thu, 26 Jan 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>maxhalford25@gmail.com (Max Halford)</author><guid>https://maxhalford.github.io/blog/openbikes-challenge/</guid><description>&lt;p>During my undergraduate internship in 2015 I started a side project called OpenBikes. The idea was to visualize and analyze bike sharing over multiple cities. &lt;a href="http://axelbellec.fr/">Axel Bellec&lt;/a> joined me and in 2016 we &lt;a href="http://www.opendatafrance.net/2016/02/05/le-prix-open-data-toulouse-metropole-remis-a-openbikes">won a national open data competition&lt;/a>. Since then we haven&amp;rsquo;t pursued anything major, instead we use OpenBikes to try out technologies and to apply concepts we learn at university and online.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Before the 2016 summer holidays one of my professors, &lt;a href="https://www.math.univ-toulouse.fr/~agarivie/">Aurélien Garivier&lt;/a> mentioned that he was considering using our data for a Kaggle-like competition between some statistics curriculums in France. Near the end of the summer, I sat down with a group of professors and we decided upon a format for the so-called &amp;ldquo;Challenge&amp;rdquo;. The general idea was to provide student teams with historical data on multiple bike stations and ask them to do some forecasting which we would then score based on a secret truth. The whole thing lasted from the 5th of October 2016 till the 26th of January 2017 when the best team was crowned.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Challenge Big Data @ TSE</title><link>https://maxhalford.github.io/blog/challenge-big-data/</link><pubDate>Mon, 09 Jan 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>maxhalford25@gmail.com (Max Halford)</author><guid>https://maxhalford.github.io/blog/challenge-big-data/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Halftoning with Go - Part 1</title><link>https://maxhalford.github.io/blog/halftoning-1/</link><pubDate>Sun, 27 Nov 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>maxhalford25@gmail.com (Max Halford)</author><guid>https://maxhalford.github.io/blog/halftoning-1/</guid><description>&lt;p>Recently I stumbled upon &lt;a href="http://www.cgl.uwaterloo.ca/csk/projects/tsp/">this webpage&lt;/a> which shows how to use a TSP solver as a &lt;a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Halftone">&lt;em>halftoning&lt;/em>&lt;/a> technique.

### Outline

My goal is to convince you that the way most people do machine learning isn't the way to go in production scenarios. Online learning is more suitable and nullifies many issues. I'll introduce a new library me and some friends have been working on, and I'll show you we're using for a pet project
trying to forecast the duration of League of Legends matches.

### Batch learning

.bullets[
1. Collect features $X$ and labels $Y$
2. Train a model on $(X, Y)$
3. Save the model somewhere
4. Load the model to make predictions
]

With code:

```python
>>> model.fit(X_train, y_train)
>>> dump(model, 'model.json')
>>> model = load('model.json')
>>> y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
```

???

The most common form of machine learning is called batch learning. It's what you do when you use scikit-learn and do Kaggle competitions. I won't dwell on this too long as I'm pretty sure you're all acquainted with it. In short: load, fit, predict.

### Batch machine learning in production

&lt;div align="center">
 &lt;img height="500px" src="https://maxhalford.github.io/img/slides/creme/batch_production.svg" />
&lt;/div>

???

There isn't a clear pattern as to how to put into production a batch learning system. Typically this involves training a model periodically, and then serializing it before saving it somewhere. API calls can then be issues to make predictions. This is such a difficult thing to get right that startups and tech giants are building products around it.

### Batch machine learning in production is hard

&lt;div align="center">
 &lt;img height="300px" src="https://maxhalford.github.io/img/slides/creme/boromir.jpg" />
&lt;/div>

???

Works fine for Kaggle cases and when you have a clear split between train and test. But things are not so smooth in production.

# Features that you develop locally might not be available in real-time

???

This is more subtle. Sometimes it isn't possible to recreate features for past instances. If you don't store information for an instance at every particular point in time, then it isn't possible to reproduce the true state during your feature extraction process. In other words you need a solid data engineering team that cares about time.

And just like Winnie the Pooh, we're spending too much time banging our heads to be able to think about a better way of doing things.

.bullets[
- Python library for doing online learning
- API heavily inspired from `sklearn` and easy to pick up
- Focus on feature extraction, not just learning
- First commit in January 2019
- Version `0.1.0` released earlier this week
]

---

### Observations

Representing an observation with a `dict` is natural:

```python
x = {
 'date': dt.datetime(2019, 4, 22),
 'price': 42.95,
 'shop': 'Ikea'
}
```

- Values can be of any type
- Feature names can be used instead of array indexes
- Python's standard library plays nicely with `dict`s

---

### Targets

A target's type depends on the context:

```python
# Regression
y = 42

# Binary classification
y = True

# Multi-class classification
y = 'setosa'

# Multi-output regression
y = {
 height: 29.7,
 width: 21
}
```

---

### Streaming data

```python
from creme import stream

X_y = stream.iter_csv('some/csv/file.csv')

for x, y in X_y:
 print(x, y)
```

- `X_y` is a **generator** and consumes a tiny amount of memory
- The point is that we want to **handle data points one by one**
- Source depends on your use case (can be Kakfa producer, CSV file, HTTP requests, etc.)

---

### Training with `fit_one`

```python
from creme import linear_model
from creme import stream

X_y = stream.iter_csv('some/csv/file.csv')

model = linear_model.LogisticRegression()

for x, y in X_y:
 model.fit_one(x, y)
```

Every `creme` estimator has a `fit_one` method

---

### Predicting with `predict_one`

```python
from creme import linear_model
from creme import stream

X_y = stream.iter_csv('some/csv/file.csv')

model = linear_model.LogisticRegression()

for x, y in X_y:
* y_pred_before = model.predict_one(x)
 model.fit_one(x, y)
* y_pred_after = model.predict_one(x)
```

- Classifiers also have a `predict_proba_one` method
- Transformers have a `transform_one` method
- Training and predicting phases are inter-leaved

---

### Monitoring performance

```python
from creme import linear_model
from creme import metrics
from creme import stream

X_y = stream.iter_csv('some/csv/file.csv')

model = linear_model.LogisticRegression()

* metric = metrics.Accuracy()

for x, y in X_y:
 y_pred = model.predict_one(x)
 model.fit_one(x, y)
* metric.update(y, y_pred)
 print(metric)
```

Validation score is available for free! No need to do any cross-validation. You can also use `online_score` from the `model_selection` module.

---

### Composing estimators is easy

```python
from creme import linear_model
from creme import metrics
from creme import preprocessing
from creme import stream

X_y = stream.iter_csv('some/csv/file.csv')

scale = preprocessing.StandardScaler()
lin_reg = linear_model.LogisticRegression()

* model = scale | lin_reg # Pipeline shorthand

metric = metrics.Accuracy()

for x, y in X_y:
 y_pred = model.predict_one(x)
 model.fit_one(x, y)
 metric.update(y, y_pred)
 print(metric)
```

---

.left-column[
- `cluster`
- `compat`
- `compose`
- `datasets`
- `dummy`
- `ensemble`

- `feature_selection`

]
.right-column[

]

---

### Online mean

For every incoming $x$, do:

1. $n = n + 1$
2. $\mu\_{i+1} = \mu\_{i} + \frac{x - \mu\_{i}}{n}$

```python
>>> mean = creme.stats.Mean()

>>> mean.update(5)
>>> mean.get()
5

>>> mean.update(10)
>>> mean.get()
7.5
```

---

### Online variance

For every incoming $x$, do:

1. $n = n + 1$
2. $\mu\_{i+1} = \mu\_{i} + \frac{x - \mu\_{i}}{n}$
3. $s\_{i+1} = s\_i + (x - \mu\_{i}) \times (x - \mu\_{i+1})$ (running sum of squares)
4. $\sigma\_{i+1} = \frac{s\_{i+1}}{n}$

```python
>>> variance = creme.stats.Variance()

>>> X = [2, 3, 4, 5]
>>> for x in X:
... variance.update(x)
>>> variance.get()
1.25

>>> numpy.var(X)
1.25

```

???

This is called Welford's algorithm, it can be extended to skew and kurtosis

---

### Standard scaling

With the mean and the variance, we can scale incoming data so that it has zero mean and unit variance.

```python
>>> scaler = creme.preprocessing.StandardScaler()

>>> for x in [2, 3, 4, 5]:
... print(x, 'becomes', scaler.fit_one(x)['x'])
2 becomes 0.0
3 becomes 0.9999999999999996
4 becomes 1.224744871391589
5 becomes 1.3416407864998738

```

&lt;/div>

---

### Linear regression (1)

Model is $y_t = \langle w_t x_t \rangle + b_t$. The weights $w_t$ can be learnt with any online gradient descent algorithm, for example:

- Stochastic gradient descent (SGD)
- Adam
- RMSProp
- Follow the Regularized Leader (FTRL)

```python
from creme import linear_model
from creme import optim

lin_reg = linear_model.LinearRegression(
 optimizer=optim.Adam(lr=0.01)
)
```

---

### Linear regression (2)

The intercept term $b_t$ is difficult to learn

Some people (Léon Bottou, scikit-learn) suggest to use a lower learning rate for the intercept than for the weights (heuristic but okay)

`creme` uses any running statistic from the `creme.stats` module, which is a powerful trick

```python
from creme import linear_model
from creme import optim
from creme import stats

lin_reg = linear_model.LinearRegression(
 optimizer=optim.Adam(lr=0.01),
 intercept=stats.RollingMean(42)
)
```

---

### Online aggregations

```python
>>> import creme

>>> X = [
... {'place': 'Taco Bell', 'revenue': 42},
... {'place': 'Burger King', 'revenue': 16},
... {'place': 'Burger King', 'revenue': 24},
... {'place': 'Taco Bell', 'revenue': 58}
... ]

>>> agg = creme.feature_extraction.Agg(
... on='revenue',
... by='place',
... how=creme.stats.Mean()
... )

>>> for x in X:
... print(agg.fit_one(x).transform_one(x))
{'revenue_mean_by_place': 42.0}
{'revenue_mean_by_place': 16.0}
{'revenue_mean_by_place': 20.0}
{'revenue_mean_by_place': 50.0}
```

---

### Bagging (1)

Bagging is a popular and simple ensemble algorithm:

1. Pick $m$ base models (usually identical copies)
2. Train each model on a sample with replacement
3. Average the predictions of each model on the test set

Each observation is sampled $K$ times where $K$ follows a binomial distribution:

$$P(K=k) = {n \choose k} \times (\frac{1}{n})^k \times (1 - \frac{1}{n})^{n-k}$$

As $n$ grows towards infinity, $K$ can be approximated by a Poisson(1):

$$P(K=k) \sim \frac{e^{-1}}{k!} $$

---

### Bagging (2)

`ensemble.BaggingClassifier` is very simple:

```python
def fit_one(self, x, y):

 for estimator in self.estimators:
 for _ in range(self.rng.poisson(1)):
 estimator.fit_one(x, y)

 return self


def predict_proba_one(self, x):
 y_pred = statistics.mean(
 estimator.predict_proba_one(x)[True]
 for estimator in self.estimators
 )
 return {
 True: y_pred,
 False: 1 - y_pred
 }
```

### Django model

```python
from django.db import models
from picklefield.fields import PickledObjectField


class CremeModel(models.Model):
 name = models.TextField(unique=True)
 pipeline = PickledObjectField()

 class Meta:
 db_table = 't_models'
 verbose_name_plural = 'models'

 def fit_one(self, x, y):
 self.pipeline.fit_one(x, y)
 return self

 def predict_one(self, x):
 return self.pipeline.predict_one(x)
```

---

class: middle

### Code for predicting

```python
match = fetch_match(match_id)

model = models.CremeModel.objects.get(name='My awesome model')

duration = model.predict_one(match.raw_info)

match.predicted_ended_at = match.started_at + predicted_duration
match.predicted_by = model
match.save()
```

---

class: middle

### Code for training

When the match ends, it has a `true_duration` property.

```python
model = models.CremeModel.objects.get(id=match.predicted_by.id)

model.fit_one(
 x=match.raw_info,
 y=match.true_duration.seconds
)

model.save()
```

---

class: middle

### Code for calculating performance

Just some Django black magic.

```python
duration = ExpressionWrapper(
 Func(F('predicted_ended_at') - F('ended_at'), function='ABS'),
 output_field=fields.DurationField()
)

agg = models.Match.objects.exclude(ended_at__isnull=True)\
 .annotate(duration=duration)\
 .aggregate(Avg('duration'))

avg_error = agg['duration__avg']
```

---

#### scikit-learn

```python
from sklearn import datasets
from sklearn import linear_model

X, y = datasets.load_boston(return_X_y=True)
model = linear_model.LinearRegression()

model.fit(X, y)
```

#### creme

```python
from creme import linear_model
from creme import stream
from sklearn import datasets

X_y = stream.iter_sklearn_dataset(datasets.load_boston)
model = linear_model.LinearRegression()

for x, y in X_y:
 model.fit_one(x, y)
```

---

class: middle

### Features

Representing a set of features using a `dict` is natural:

```python
x = {
 'date': dt.datetime(2019, 4, 22),
 'price': 42.95,
 'shop': 'Ikea'
}
```

- Values can be of any type
- Feature names can be used instead of array indexes
- Python's standard library plays nicely with `dict`s

---

class: middle

### Targets

A target's type depends on the context:

```python
# Regression
y = 42

# Binary classification
y = True

# Multi-class classification
y = 'setosa'

# Multi-output regression
y = {
 height: 29.7,
 width: 21
}
```

---

class: middle

### Streaming data

```python
from creme import stream

X_y = stream.iter_csv('some/csv/file.csv')

for x, y in X_y:
 print(x, y)
```

- `X_y` is a **generator** and consumes a tiny amount of memory
- The point is that we only need one data point at a time
- Source depends on your use case (CSV file, Kafka consumer, HTTP requests)

---

class: middle

### Training with `fit_one`

```python
from creme import linear_model
from creme import stream

X_y = stream.iter_csv('some/csv/file.csv')

model = linear_model.LogisticRegression()

for x, y in X_y:
* model.fit_one(x, y)
```

Every `creme` estimator has a `fit_one` method

---

class: middle

### Predicting with `predict_one`

```python
from creme import linear_model
from creme import stream

X_y = stream.iter_csv('some/csv/file.csv')

model = linear_model.LogisticRegression()

for x, y in X_y:
* y_pred = model.predict_one(x)
 model.fit_one(x, y)
```

- Classifiers also have a `predict_proba_one` method
- Transformers have a `transform_one` method
- Training and predicting phases are inter-leaved

---

class: middle

### Progressive validation 💯

```python
from creme import linear_model
from creme import metrics
from creme import stream

X_y = stream.iter_csv('some/csv/file.csv')

model = linear_model.LogisticRegression()

metric = metrics.Accuracy()

for x, y in X_y:
 y_pred = model.predict_one(x)
 model.fit_one(x, y)
* metric.update(y, y_pred)
 print(metric)
```

Validation score is available for free! No need for cross-validation. You can also use `online_score` from the `model_selection` module.

---

class: middle

### Composing estimators is easy

```python
from creme import compose
from creme import linear_model
from creme import preprocessing

scale = preprocessing.StandardScaler()
lin_reg = linear_model.LogisticRegression()

# You can do this...
model = compose.Pipeline([
 ('scale', scale),
 ('lin_reg', lin_reg
])

# Or this...
model = scale | lin_reg
```

# Questions?

---

### Online mean

For every incoming $x$, do:

1. $n = n + 1$
2. $\mu\_{i+1} = \mu\_{i} + \frac{x - \mu\_{i}}{n}$

```python
>>> mean = creme.stats.Mean()

>>> mean.update(5)
>>> mean.get()
5

>>> mean.update(10)
>>> mean.get()
7.5
```

---

### Online variance

For every incoming $x$, do:

1. $n = n + 1$
2. $\mu\_{i+1} = \mu\_{i} + \frac{x - \mu\_{i}}{n}$
3. $s\_{i+1} = s\_i + (x - \mu\_{i}) \times (x - \mu\_{i+1})$
4. $\sigma\_{i+1} = \frac{s\_{i+1}}{n}$

```python
>>> variance = creme.stats.Variance()

>>> X = [2, 3, 4, 5]
>>> for x in X:
... variance.update(x)
>>> variance.get()
1.25

>>> numpy.var(X)
1.25

```

???

This is called Welford's algorithm, it can be extended to skew and kurtosis

---

### Standard scaling

Using the mean and the variance, we can rescale incoming data.

```python
>>> scaler = creme.preprocessing.StandardScaler()

>>> for x in [2, 3, 4, 5]:
... features = {'x': x}
... scaler.fit_one(features)
... new_x = scaler.transform_one(features)['x']
... print(f'{x} becomes {new_x})
2 becomes 0.0
3 becomes 0.9999999999999996
4 becomes 1.224744871391589
5 becomes 1.3416407864998738

```

 &lt;iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/nlWGe7Q64zwQ0" width="480" height="180" frameBorder="0" class="giphy-embed" allowFullScreen>&lt;/iframe>
&lt;/div>

---

### Linear regression (1)

Model is $y_t = \langle w_t x_t \rangle + b_t$. The weights $w_t$ can be learnt with any online gradient descent algorithm, for example:

- Stochastic gradient descent (SGD)
- Adam
- RMSProp
- Follow the Regularized Leader (FTRL)

```python
from creme import linear_model
from creme import optim

lin_reg = linear_model.LinearRegression(
 optimizer=optim.Adam(lr=0.01)
)
```

---

### Linear regression (2)

Some people (Léon Bottou, scikit-learn) suggest to use a lower learning rate for the intercept than for the weights (heuristic but okay)

`creme` uses any running statistic from the `creme.stats` module, which is a powerful trick

```python
from creme import linear_model
from creme import optim
from creme import stats

lin_reg = linear_model.LinearRegression(
 optimizer=optim.Adam(lr=0.01),
 intercept=stats.RollingMean(42)
)
```

---

### Online aggregations

```python
>>> import creme

>>> X = [
... {'meal': 🍕, 'sales': 42},
... {'meal': 🍔, 'sales': 16},
... {'meal': 🍔, 'sales': 24},
... {'meal': 🍕, 'sales': 58}
... ]

>>> agg = creme.feature_extraction.Agg(
... on='sales',
... by='meal',
... how=creme.stats.Mean()
... )

>>> for x in X:
... print(agg.fit_one(x).transform_one(x))
{'sales_mean_by_meal': 42.0}
{'sales_mean_by_meal': 16.0}
{'sales_mean_by_meal': 20.0}
{'sales_mean_by_meal': 50.0}
```

---

### Bagging (1)

Each observation is sampled $K$ times where $K$ follows a binomial distribution:

$$P(K=k) = {n \choose k} \times (\frac{1}{n})^k \times (1 - \frac{1}{n})^{n-k}$$

As $n$ grows towards infinity, $K$ can be approximated by a Poisson(1):

$$P(K=k) \sim \frac{e^{-1}}{k!} $$

This leads to a simple and efficient online algorithm.

---

### Bagging (2)

`ensemble.BaggingClassifier` is very simple:

```python
def fit_one(self, x, y):

 for estimator in self.estimators:
 for _ in range(self.rng.poisson(1)):
 estimator.fit_one(x, y)

 return self


def predict_proba_one(self, x):
 y_pred = statistics.mean(
 estimator.predict_proba_one(x)[True]
 for estimator in self.estimators
 )
 return {
 True: y_pred,
 False: 1 - y_pred
 }
```

---

### Decision trees 🌳

- A version of Hoeffding trees is being implemented
- Basic idea:
 - Start with a leaf 🍃
 - Find the leaf where an observation belongs 🔎
 - Update the leaf's sufficient statistics 📊
 - Measure information gain every so often 🔬
 - Split when the information gain is good enough 🍂
- Mondrian trees 👨‍🎨 are another possibility but they only work for continuous attributes

## Batch learning in production has issues

.bigbullets[

1. Models are retrained from scratch with new data 🕒
2. Models require powerful machines 💰
3. Models are static and "rot" faster than bananas 🍌
4. Models that work in development don't always work in production 🤷

- [Continuum: a platform for cost-aware low-latency continual learning](https://blog.acolyer.org/2018/11/21/continuum-a-platform-for-cost-aware-low-latency-continual-learning/)
- [Applied machine learning at Facebook: a datacenter infrastructure perspective](https://blog.acolyer.org/2018/12/17/applied-machine-learning-at-facebook-a-datacenter-infrastructure-perspective/)

As we looked at last month with Continuum, the latency of incorporating the latest data into the models is also really important. There’s a nice section of this paper where the authors study the impact of losing the ability to train models for a period of time and have to serve requests from stale models. The Community Integrity team for example rely on frequently trained models to keep up with the ever changing ways adversaries try to bypass Facebook’s protections and show objectionable content to users. Here training iterations take on the order of days. Even more dependent on the incorporation of recent data into models is the news feed ranking. “Stale News Feed models have a measurable impact on quality.” And if we look at the very core of the business, the Ads Ranking models, “we learned that the impact of leveraging a stale ML model is measured in hours. In other words, using a one-day-old model is measurably worse than using a one-hour old model.” One of the conclusions in this section of the paper is that disaster recovery / high availability for training workloads is key importance. (Another place to practice your chaos engineering ;) ).

### Features

Representing a set of features using a `dict` is natural:

```python
x = {
 'date': dt.datetime(2019, 4, 22),
 'price': 42.95,
 'shop': 'Ikea'
}
```

- Values can be of any type
- Feature names can be used instead of array indexes
- Web request payloads are dictionaries

---

class: middle

### Targets

A target's type depends on the context:

```python
# Regression
y = 42

# Binary classification
y = True

# Multi-class classification
y = 'setosa'

# Multi-output regression
y = {
 'height': 29.7,
 'width': 21
}
```

---

class: middle

### Streaming data

```python
from creme import stream

X_y = stream.iter_csv('some/csv/file.csv')

for x, y in X_y:
 print(x, y)
```

- `X_y` is a **generator**, it doesn't hold data in memory
- Source depends on your use case (CSV file, Kafka consumer, HTTP requests)

---

class: middle

### Training with `fit_one`

```python
from creme import linear_model
from creme import stream

X_y = stream.iter_csv('some/csv/file.csv')

model = linear_model.LogisticRegression()

for x, y in X_y:
* model.fit_one(x, y)
```

Every `creme` estimator has a `fit_one` method

---

class: middle

### Predicting with `predict_one`

```python
from creme import linear_model
from creme import stream

X_y = stream.iter_csv('some/csv/file.csv')

model = linear_model.LogisticRegression()

for x, y in X_y:
* y_pred = model.predict_one(x)
 model.fit_one(x, y)
```

- Classifiers also have a `predict_proba_one` method
- Transformers have a `transform_one` method
- Training and predicting phases are inter-leaved

---

class: middle

### Progressive validation 💯

```python
from creme import linear_model
from creme import metrics
from creme import stream

X_y = stream.iter_csv('some/csv/file.csv')

model = linear_model.LogisticRegression()

metric = metrics.Accuracy()

for x, y in X_y:
 y_pred = model.predict_one(x)
 model.fit_one(x, y)
* metric.update(y, y_pred)
 print(metric)
```

Validation score is available for free! No need for cross-validation. You can also use `online_score` from the `model_selection` module.

### Composing estimators is easy

.left-column[
```python
from creme import *

counts = feature_extraction.CountVectorizer()
tdidf = feature_extraction.TFIDFVectorizer()

scale = preprocessing.StandardScaler()

log_reg = linear_model.LogisticRegression()

model = (counts + tdidf) | scale | log_reg

model.draw()
```
]

&lt;/div>

### Online mean

For every incoming $x$, do:

1. $n = n + 1$
2. $\mu\_{i+1} = \mu\_{i} + \frac{x - \mu\_{i}}{n}$

```python
>>> mean = creme.stats.Mean()

>>> mean.update(5)
>>> mean.get()
5

>>> mean.update(10)
>>> mean.get()
7.5
```

---

### Online variance

For every incoming $x$, do:

1. $n = n + 1$
2. $\mu\_{i+1} = \mu\_{i} + \frac{x - \mu\_{i}}{n}$
3. $s\_{i+1} = s\_i + (x - \mu\_{i}) \times (x - \mu\_{i+1})$
4. $\sigma\_{i+1} = \frac{s\_{i+1}}{n}$

```python
>>> variance = creme.stats.Variance()

>>> X = [2, 3, 4, 5]
>>> for x in X:
... variance.update(x)
>>> variance.get()
1.25

>>> numpy.var(X)
1.25

```

???

This is called Welford's algorithm, it can be extended to skew and kurtosis

---

class: middle

### Standard scaling

Using the mean and the variance, we can rescale incoming data.

```python
>>> scaler = creme.preprocessing.StandardScaler()

>>> for x in [2, 3, 4, 5]:
... features = {'x': x}
... scaler.fit_one(features)
... new_x = scaler.transform_one(features)['x']
... print(f'{x} becomes {new_x})
2 becomes 0.0
3 becomes 0.9999999999999996
4 becomes 1.224744871391589
5 becomes 1.3416407864998738

```

In practice, works better than normalized gradient descent 😲

---

class: middle

### Linear models

Model is:

$$\hat{y}_t = f(w_t, x_t) + b_t$$

Update weights with gradients:

$$w_{t+1} = u(w_t, x_t, \partial L(y_t, \hat{y}_t))$$

Many models can be derived, for example:

- Use Hinge loss for SVM
- Add L1/L2 regularisation for LASSO/ridge
- Add interactions for factorization machines

### Many online optimizers to choose from

.bullets[
- Stochastic gradient descent (SGD)
- Passive-Aggressive (PA)
- ADAM
- RMSProp
- Follow the Regularized Leader (FTRL)

]

&lt;div align="center">
Many variants of each, as you know
&lt;/div>

class: middle

### Bayesian linear models

We want the posterior target distribution on the target:

$$\color{forestgreen} p(y\_t | x\_t) \color{black} \propto \color{crimson} p(y_t | w_t, x_t) \color{royalblue} p(w_t)$$

We first need to compute the posterior distribution of the weights:

$$\color{blueviolet} p(w\_{t} | w\_{t-1}, x\_t, y\_t) \color{black} \propto \color{crimson} p(y\_t | w\_{t-1}, x\_t) \color{royalblue} p(w\_{t-1})$$

This is old-school Bayesian learning, it is different from and predecesses the Monte-Carlo mumbo-jumbo.

---

class: middle

### Online belief updating

Before any data comes in, the model parameters follow the initial distribution we picked, which is $\color{royalblue} p(w\_0)$. Next, once the first observation $(x\_0, y\_0)$ arrives, we can obtain the distribution of $w\_1$:

$$\color{blueviolet} p(w\_1 | w\_0, x\_0, y\_0) \color{black} \propto \color{crimson} p(y\_0 | w\_0, x\_0) \color{royalblue} p(w\_0)$$

Once the second observation $(x\_1, y\_1)$ is available, the distribution of the model parameters is obtained in the same way:

$$\color{blueviolet} p(w\_2 | w\_1, x\_1, y\_1) \color{black} \propto \color{crimson} p(y\_1 | w\_1, x\_1) \color{royalblue} p(w\_1) \propto \color{crimson} p(y\_1 | w\_1, x\_1) \color{blueviolet} p(w\_1 | w\_0, x\_0, y\_0)$$

The $\propto$ symbol means there is an analytical formula that can be derived.

### Decision trees 🌳

- A version of Hoeffding trees is being implemented
- Basic idea:
 - Start with a leaf 🍃
 - Find the leaf where an observation belongs 🔎
 - Update the leaf's "sufficient statistics" 📊
 - Measure information gain every so often 🔬
 - Split when the information gain is good enough 🍂
- Mondrian trees 👨‍🎨 are another possibility but they only work for continuous attributes

---

class: middle

### Decision trees 🌳

Quality criterion of split $x &lt; t$ can be evaluated with:

$$P(y \mid x &lt; t) = \frac{P(x &lt; t \mid y) \times P(y)}{P(x &lt; t)}$$

and:

$$P(y \mid x \geq t) = \frac{(1 - P(x &lt; t \mid y)) \times P(y)}{1 - P(x &lt; t)}$$

- For classification, $P(x &lt; t \mid y)$ is a set of online CDFs and $P(y)$ is a PMF.
- For regression, $P(x &lt; t \mid y)$ is a 2D CDF and $P(y)$ is a PDF
- All these distributions can be updated online

---

class: middle

### Bagging

Each observation is sampled $K$ times where $K$ follows a binomial distribution:

$$P(K=k) = {n \choose k} \times (\frac{1}{n})^k \times (1 - \frac{1}{n})^{n-k}$$

As $n$ grows towards infinity, $K$ can be approximated by a Poisson(1):

$$P(K=k) \sim \frac{e^{-1}}{k!} $$

This leads to a simple and efficient online algorithm:

```python
for model in models:
 for _ in range(random.poisson(λ=1)):
 model.fit_one(x, y)
```

---

class: middle

### (S)(N)(AR)(I)(MA)(X)

ARMA model is defined as so:

$$\hat{y}\_t = \sum\_{i=1}^p \alpha\_i y\_{t-i} + \sum\_{i=1}^q \beta\_i (y\_{t-i} - \hat{y}\_{t-i}) $$

Classically, Kalman filters are used to find the weights $\alpha\_i$ and $\beta\_i$. But $y\_{t-i}$ and $\hat{y}\_{t-i}$ can also be [seen as features in an online setting](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3016160):

- Seasonality can be handled online
- Any online learning model can be used
- Detrending by differencing can be done online
- Heteroscedasticity can be handled online
- Exogenous variables can be added

---

### Online aggregated features

```python
>>> import creme

>>> X = [
... {'meal': 'tika masala', 'sales': 42},
... {'meal': 'kale salad', 'sales': 16},
... {'meal': 'kale salad', 'sales': 24},
... {'meal': 'tika masala', 'sales': 58}
... ]

>>> agg = creme.feature_extraction.Agg(
... on='sales',
... by='meal',
... how=creme.stats.Mean()
... )

>>> for x in X:
... print(agg.fit_one(x).transform_one(x))
{'sales_mean_by_meal': 42.0}
{'sales_mean_by_meal': 16.0}
{'sales_mean_by_meal': 20.0}
{'sales_mean_by_meal': 50.0}

# Symbolic regression

---

## Quick overview

- The goal is to evolve "programs" with selection, mutation, and crossover
- Selection keeps programs that perform well
- Mutation changes a piece of the program
- Crossover combines two programs

## Types of nodes

- Constants
- Variables
- Functions

Huge search space because the shape of the model is included in the search space 🙊

---

## Algorithm (high-level) ➰

```python
programs = make_random_programs()

for i in range(generations):
 evaluate(programs)
 new_programs = select(programs)
 crossover(new_programs)
 mutate(new_programs)
 programs = new_programs
```

---

## Mutation

---

## Crossover 💏

---

## Evaluation 💯

---

## Selection 

---

## Initialization

---

## Pros 😺

- Flexible model
- Built-in feature selection
- Can optimise non-differentiable metrics
- Useful for stacking
- Makes you look cool 😎

---

## Cons 😿

- Black box model
- No mathematical foundation
- Requires a lot of CPU power
- Non-deterministic and volatile

## Enter XGP 🎉

- Written in [Go](https://golang.org/) 
- Optimization done with [gago](https://github.com/MaxHalford/gago)
- SIMD operations thanks to [gonum](https://www.gonum.org/) ⚡
- Readable code 📖
- Very customizable (with sensible defaults!)
- Command line interface (CLI) 💻
- Python bindings (scikit-learn API) 🐍

---

## Command line interface (CLI) 💻

```sh
$ xgp fit train.csv
```

```sh
$ xgp predict test.csv
```

---

## Python package 🐍

### Regression 📈

```python
model = xgp.XGPRegressor()

model.fit(X_train, y_train)

y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
```

---

## Python package 🐍

### Feature extraction 🔬

```py
model = xgp.XGPTransformer()

model.fit(X_train, y_train)

train_gp_features = model.predict(X_train)
test_gp_features = model.predict(X_test)
```

---

## Future work 🔮

- Binary and multi-class classification
- Boosting (promising)
- Caching to handle large datasets
- More bindings (R, Ruby, ...)
- Extensive testing
- Documentation and examples
