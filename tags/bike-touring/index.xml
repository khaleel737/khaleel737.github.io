We usually go for a couple of weeks, and we&amp;rsquo;ve been doing it regularly over the past five years. We&amp;rsquo;ve cycled in France and England so far. Both countries have many affordable campsites, and there&amp;rsquo;s always a decent hotel/Airbnb not too far for when it&amp;rsquo;s raining.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>But this year we travelled through Switzerland, which is prohibitively expensive, and somewhat lacking in terms of places to camp. We were aware of &lt;a href="https://www.warmshowers.org/">Warmshowers&lt;/a> and decided to give it a try. It was fantastic, and opened our eyes on what travelling and &lt;a href="https://talk.bradwoods.io/blog/connect/">connecting&lt;/a> with people can be like. I don&amp;rsquo;t think we&amp;rsquo;ll ever travel like we used to anymore.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
