I hate it but I promised myself to give it a real try. My scripts are taking a long time so I decided to do some procedural art while I waited. This time I&amp;rsquo;m going to reproduce the following crosses made by &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fran%C3%A7ois_Morellet"&gt;François Morellet&lt;/a&gt;. I saw them the last I went to the Musée Pompidou with some friends from university. I don&amp;rsquo;t have any smartphone anymore so one my friends was kind enough to take a few pictures for me, including this one. The painting is called &lt;a href="https://www.centrepompidou.fr/cpv/resource/cxx585o/ryjG5EL"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Violet, bleu, vert, jaune, orange, rouge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Stella triangles with JavaScript</title><link>https://maxhalford.github.io/blog/stella-triangles/</link><pubDate>Thu, 26 Apr 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>maxhalford25@gmail.com (Max Halford)</author><guid>https://maxhalford.github.io/blog/stella-triangles/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Around the same time last year I visited the &lt;a href="https://www.sfmoma.org/"&gt;San Francisco Museum of Modern Art&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Stella"&gt;Frank Stella&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rsquo;s compositions really caught my eye. When I saw them I started thinking about how I could write a computer program to imitate his work. In this post I&amp;rsquo;m going to attempt to reproduce his so-called &lt;em&gt;V Series&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://maxhalford.github.io/img/blog/stella-triangles/1.jpg" alt="1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://maxhalford.github.io/img/blog/stella-triangles/2.jpg" alt="2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nice and simple right? Indeed in a lot of his work Frank Stella uses straight lines without much randomness. There are quite a few prints in the V Series. However in each one of them the common denominator is a single triangle. If we have a routine for drawing one triangle then we can use to make compositions. As always let&amp;rsquo;s start by creating a canvas.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Unknown pleasures with JavaScript</title><link>https://maxhalford.github.io/blog/unknown-pleasures/</link><pubDate>Mon, 24 Jul 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>maxhalford25@gmail.com (Max Halford)</author><guid>https://maxhalford.github.io/blog/unknown-pleasures/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;No this blog post is not about how nice JavaScript can be, instead it&amp;rsquo;s just another one of my attempts at reproducing modern art with &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedural_generation"&gt;procedural generation&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_canvas.asp"&gt;HTML5 &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;canvas&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; element&lt;/a&gt;. This time I randomly generated images resembling the cover of the album by Joy Division called &amp;ldquo;Unknown Pleasures&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://maxhalford.github.io/img/blog/unknown-pleasures/album.png" alt="album"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unknown_Pleasures#/Artwork_and_packaging"&gt;According to Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;, this somewhat iconic album cover is based on radio waves. I saw a poster of it in a bar not long ago and decided to reproduce the next time I had some time to kill.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Grid paintings à la Mondrian with JavaScript</title><link>https://maxhalford.github.io/blog/mondrian/</link><pubDate>Sat, 04 Mar 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>maxhalford25@gmail.com (Max Halford)</author><guid>https://maxhalford.github.io/blog/mondrian/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;I was at a laundrette today and had just finished my book so I had some time to kill. Naturally I devised an algorithm for generating drawings that would resemble the &lt;a href="https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=piet+mondrian+grid+painting"&gt;grid-like paintings&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piet_Mondrian"&gt;Piet Mondrian&lt;/a&gt; made famous. With the benefit of hindsight I guess I could indulge in saner activities while waiting for my laundry to dry!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went through different ideas but in the end I settled on a recursive approach. My idea is to divide a rectangle into two smaller ones and then to do the same with each sub-rectangle. Every time a rectangle is generated and is then filled with a random color; like Mondrian I use yellow, red, blue, black and white.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Recursive polygons with JavaScript</title><link>https://maxhalford.github.io/blog/recursive-polygons/</link><pubDate>Fri, 25 Mar 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>maxhalford25@gmail.com (Max Halford)</author><guid>https://maxhalford.github.io/blog/recursive-polygons/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;I like modern art, I enjoy looking at the stuff that was made at the beginning of the 20th century and thinking how it is still shaping today&amp;rsquo;s style. I&amp;rsquo;m not an expert, it&amp;rsquo;s just a hobby of mine. I especially like the &lt;a href="https://www.centrepompidou.fr/"&gt;Centre Pompidou&lt;/a&gt; in Paris, it&amp;rsquo;s got loads of fascinating stuff. While I was going through the galleries it struck me that some of the paintings were very geometrical. In fact they were so geometrical that a machine could have produced them! I&amp;rsquo;m not talking about artificial intelligence but rather a set of rules that could be given to a programming language. Through a series of blog posts I would like to try to emulate some works with my computer. I realize it&amp;rsquo;s a waste of time but it&amp;rsquo;s a good opportunity for me to learn some more JavaScript and refreshen my geometry. I also want to insist on making these drawings random, not deterministic.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
