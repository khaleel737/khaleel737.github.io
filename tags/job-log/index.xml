&lt;p&gt;Today marks the 1 year anniversary since I started working at &lt;a href="https://alan.com/"&gt;Alan&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s my first real job, and certainly the place where I grew up the most professionally. I&amp;rsquo;m writing this post to summarise what I did and what I learnt at Alan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alan is a special company. It has a unique culture that is starting to become famous in France. I won&amp;rsquo;t expand on the way things work at Alan, and will simply focus on the way I experienced it. Let me just say this: it works. The pace at which stuff gets shipped is insane. And yet, it&amp;rsquo;s a healthy environment to be working in. Alaners are some of the kindest and wisest human beings I&amp;rsquo;ve had the chance to meet.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>What my PhD was about</title><link>https://khaleel737.github.io/blog/phd-about/</link><pubDate>Wed, 06 Jan 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>maxhalford25@gmail.com (Khaleel Musleh)</author><guid>https://khaleel737.github.io/blog/phd-about/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;I defended my PhD thesis on the 12th of October 2020, exactly 3 years and 11 days after having started it. The title of my PhD is &lt;em&gt;Machine learning for query selectivity estimation in relational databases&lt;/em&gt;. I thought it would be worthwhile to summarise what I did. Note sure anyone will read this, but at least I&amp;rsquo;ll be able to remember what I did when I grow old and senile.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
