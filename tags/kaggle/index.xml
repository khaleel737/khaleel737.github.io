&lt;p&gt;I co-organised a data science competition during the second half of 2020. This was in fact the 5th edition of the &amp;ldquo;Défi IA&amp;rdquo;, which is a recurring event that happens on a yearly basis. It is essentially a supervised machine learning competition for students from French speaking universities and engineering schools. This year was the first time that Kaggle was used to host the competition. Before that we used a custom platform that I wrote during my student years.

The idea was to visualize and analyze bike sharing over multiple cities. &lt;a href="http://axelbellec.fr/"&gt;Axel Bellec&lt;/a&gt; joined me and in 2016 we &lt;a href="http://www.opendatafrance.net/2016/02/05/le-prix-open-data-toulouse-metropole-remis-a-openbikes"&gt;won a national open data competition&lt;/a&gt;. Since then we haven&amp;rsquo;t pursued anything major, instead we use OpenBikes to try out technologies and to apply concepts we learn at university and online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before the 2016 summer holidays one of my professors, &lt;a href="https://www.math.univ-toulouse.fr/~agarivie/"&gt;Aurélien Garivier&lt;/a&gt; mentioned that he was considering using our data for a Kaggle-like competition between some statistics curriculums in France. Near the end of the summer, I sat down with a group of professors and we decided upon a format for the so-called &amp;ldquo;Challenge&amp;rdquo;. The general idea was to provide student teams with historical data on multiple bike stations and ask them to do some forecasting which we would then score based on a secret truth. The whole thing lasted from the 5th of October 2016 till the 26th of January 2017 when the best team was crowned.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
