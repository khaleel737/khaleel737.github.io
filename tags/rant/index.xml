&lt;p>&lt;em>Let me be absolutely clear: I think dbt is a great tool. Although this post is a rant, the goal is to be constructive and suggest an improvement.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://www.getdbt.com/">dbt&lt;/a> is a workflow orchestrator for SQL.

It said out loud what many data teams were thinking: you can get a lot done with SQL.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>I got plagiarized and Google didn't help</title><link>https://maxhalford.github.io/blog/plagiarism-google-didnt-help/</link><pubDate>Fri, 17 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>maxhalford25@gmail.com (Max Halford)</author><guid>https://maxhalford.github.io/blog/plagiarism-google-didnt-help/</guid><description>&lt;p>One of my most popular articles is &lt;a href="https://maxhalford.github.io/blog/target-encoding">the one on target encoding&lt;/a>.

Up to a few months ago, my article was on the first page of Google when you typed in searches such as &amp;ldquo;&lt;em>target encoding python&lt;/em>&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;&lt;em>bayesian target encoding&lt;/em>&amp;rdquo;. This was purely organic and it felt nice to have a relevant article, even though that&amp;rsquo;s not the main reason why I blog.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
